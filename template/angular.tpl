                <h1>What is Angular?</h1>
                <p> Angular is an application design framework and development platform for creating efficient and sophisticated single-page apps. 
                These Angular docs help you learn and use the Angular framework and development platform, from your first application to optimizing 
                complex single-page apps for enterprises. Tutorials and guides include downloadable examples to accelerate your projects. Angular is 
                a development platform, built on TypeScript. As a platform, Angular includes:
                <ul>
                    <li>A component-based framework for building scalable web applications</li>
                    <li>A collection of well-integrated libraries that cover a wide variety of 
                    features, including routing, forms management, client-server communication, and more</li>
                    <li>A suite of developer tools to help you develop, build, test, and update your code</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                
                <p>With Angular, you're taking advantage of a platform that can scale from single-developer projects to enterprise-level applications. 
                Angular is designed to make updating as easy as possible, so you can take advantage of the latest developments with a minimum of effort. 
                Best of all, the Angular ecosystem consists of a diverse group of over 1.7 million developers, library authors, and content creators.</p>

                <h1>Angular applications: The essentials</h1>
                <p>This section explains the core ideas behind Angular. Understanding these ideas can help you design and build your applications more effectively.
                </p>
                <h3>Components</h3>
                <p>Components are the building blocks that compose an application. A component includes a TypeScript class with a @Component() decorator, an HTML template, 
                and styles. The @Component() decorator specifies the following Angular-specific information:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A CSS selector that defines how the component is used in a template. HTML elements in your template that match this selector become instances of the component.</li>
                    <li>An HTML template that instructs Angular how to render the component.</li>
                    <li>An optional set of CSS styles that define the appearance of the template's HTML elements.</li>
                </ul>
