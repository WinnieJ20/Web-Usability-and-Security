						<h2>Multiplayer IO Game Website</h2>
						<p>Design and create a complete web game which is <br>eligible to be a member of the large io games family</p>
					</div>
					
					<h3>What is an .io game?</h3>
					<p>
						The two letters of IO do not mean anything, but the original developers of this type of game like to put the game on 
						<br>the domain name of http://XXX.io, so now IO is used to refer to this type of game. Many famous .io games such as 
						<br>Ager.io and Slither.io are all characterized by some similiar features, including multiplayer confrontation + map limi
						<br>tation + immediate resurrection after death...
						<br>
						<br>
						What are the core features of the .io game?
						<br>
						<br>
						1. Real-time multiplayer battles, you need to have competitive relationships with other players to have fun;<br>
						2. Play immediately, there is no permanent growth system, every game is a fresh start;<br>
						3. The more growth the player gains, the more restricted effects he will receive, such as the slower moving speed 
						<br>of high-level players;<br>
						4. Simple growth system: 1. Obtain resources; 2. Kill opponents.
						<br>

					</p>
					
					<h3>What should we do?</h3>
					<p>
						As an participant, you will need to bulid an .io game with your teammates in the given time using the web develop
						<br>ing techniques you have learnt.
					</p>

					<h3>Instructions:</h3>
					<p>
						We want your code at the end of the day. Please follow these instructions closely!<br>
						Please fork the hackathon repo (shown below)<br>
						Do not make any changes yet<br>
						Create a new branch with your team name.<br>
						Your team should commit all their code to your team's branch.<br>
						At the end of the day, push your branch up to the original repo.<br>
					</p>

					<h3>At The End of The Day My Team :</h3>
					<p>
						Will have the web game running on our test sever that can let multiple players to compete against each other.<br>
						Will deliver a 5 minute presentation on their thoughts and approach - whether the game is itself is considered 
						<br>to be creative or not.<br>
						Will submit the code files to the master repo so we can test its playability.<br>
					</p>

					<h3>As a winner you will get: </h3>
					<p>
						A lot of development experience.<br>
						Opportunities to meet more interesting people.<br>
