                <h1>Intro to JQuery</h1>
                <p> jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and 
                manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude 
                of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.

                <h1>About JQuery</h1>
                <p> Getting started with jQuery can be easy or challenging, depending on your experience with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, 
                and programming concepts in general. In addition to these articles, you can read about the history of jQuery and the 
                licensing terms that apply to jQuery projects. You can also make a donation to help the jQuery team continue to improve jQuery.
                One important thing to know is that jQuery is just a JavaScript library. All the power of jQuery is accessed via JavaScript, 
                so having a strong grasp of JavaScript is essential for understanding, structuring, and debugging your code. While working 
                with jQuery regularly can, over time, improve your proficiency with JavaScript, it can be hard to get started writing jQuery 
                without a working knowledge of JavaScript's built-in constructs and syntax. Therefore, if you're new to JavaScript, we 
                recommend checking out the JavaScript basics tutorial on the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN).

                <h1>How JQuery Works</h1>
                <p>This is a basic tutorial, designed to help you get started using jQuery. If you don't have a test page setup yet, start by 
                creating the following HTML page:</p>
                <img src="img/jquery-sample.png" alt="">
                <p>
                The src attribute in the &lt;script&gt; element must point to a copy of jQuery. Download a copy of jQuery from the Downloading jQuery 
                page and store the jquery.js file in the same directory as your HTML file.
                </p>
